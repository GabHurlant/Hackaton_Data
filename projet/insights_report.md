## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonality

- **Peak month**: Jan
- Flu season (October-March) shows consistently higher activity
- Summer months have 40-60% lower emergency visits

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regional Patterns

- **High-burden regions**: Guyane, Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur, √éle-de-France, Corse, Hauts-de-France
- Top 25% of regions account for majority of emergency visits
- Significant regional variation suggests need for localized strategies

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Epidemic Patterns

- Detected **61 epidemic peaks** above threshold
- Epidemic threshold: 83758 visits per week
- Most peaks occur in January-February

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendations

### For Forecasting Model:
- Include seasonal features (month, quarter, flu_season flag)
- Add regional indicators (high_burden flag)
- Use lag features (1, 2, 4 weeks prior)
- Consider separate models for flu vs non-flu season

### For Vaccine Distribution:
- Prioritize high-burden regions identified above
- Time campaigns for September-October (before flu season)
- Maintain emergency stock for January-February peaks
